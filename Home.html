        <h2>BREAKFAST RESTAURANT</h2>
        <p>Owner, Brian McDermott had a passion for working in restaurants and The Original Pancake House was a perfect fit. He started as a General Manager in Toledo, Ohio in 1979. After years of experience within the industry, he realized he wanted an Original Pancake House of his own. In 1986, Brian McDermott brought the breakfast franchise to Indianapolis, Indiana within Union Station. Many of the item names listed on our Kid’s Menu are in reference to the historic train station. Since 1996, The Original Pancake House in downtown Indianapolis has been closed, but Brian and his family have worked hard to keep their three current locations (Indianapolis, Fishers and Noblesville) running smoothly. His wife Charlene, daughter Colleen and son Andrew are devoted to keeping The Original Pancake House a part of Indianapolis’s history and your favorite breakfast restaurant!
